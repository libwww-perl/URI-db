This project proposes a standard for database connection URIs and provides a
simple Perl implementation. This figure summarizes the definition syntax and
for database URIs (illustration adapted from
[RFC 3986](http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc3986) --- STD 66, chapter 3):

      db:engine://username:password@example.com:8042/widgets.db?tz=utc&charset=utf8#users
      \/ \____/   \_______________/ \_________/ \__/ \________/ \/ \__/ \____/ \__/\____/
       |    |             |              |       |        |     |    |     |    |     |
       |    |         userinfo        hostname  port      |    key   |    key   |     |
       |    |     \________________________________/      |          |          |     |
       |    |                      |                      |        value      value   |
       |  engine                   |                      |     \_________________/   |
    scheme  |                  authority         db name or path         |            |
     name   |     \___________________________________________/        query       fragment
       |    |                           |
       |    |                   hierarchical part
       |    |
       |    |      db name or path       query    fragment
       |  __|_   ________|________    _____|____  ____|____
      /\ /    \ /                 \  /          \/         \
      db:engine:my_big_fat_database?encoding=big5#log.animals

Notes on this syntax:

* The Database URI *scheme* is `db`. Consequently, database URIs always start
  with `db:`. This is the [URI scheme](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/URI_scheme)
  that defines a database URI.

* Next comes the database *engine*. This part is a string naming the type of
  database engine for the database. It must always be followed by a colon, `:`.
  There is no formal list of supported engines, though certain implementations
  may specify engine-specific semantics, such as a default port.

* The *authority* part is separated from the engine by a double slash, `//`,
  and terminated by the next slash or end of the URI. It consists of an
  optional user-information part, terminated by `@` (e.g.,
  `username:password@`); a host address (e.g., domain name or IP address); and
  an optional port number, preceded by a colon, `:`.

* The *path* part specifies the database name or path. It must be separated
  from the authority, if the authority is present, by a single slash, `/`. If
  the database name is a full path, it may start with an additional slash.

* The optional *query* part, separated by a question mark, `?`, contains
  `key=value` pairs separated by a semicolon, `;`, or ampersand, `&`. These
  parameters may be used to configure a database connection with parameters not
  directly supported by the rest of the URI format.

* The optional *fragment* part, separted by a hash mark, `#`, contains
  additional context information, such as a table or view name.

Here are some database URIs without an authority part, which is typical for
non-server engines such as [SQLite](http://sqlite.org/), where the path part
is a relative or absolute file name:

* `db:sqlite:`
* `db:sqlite:foo.db`
* `db:sqlite:../foo.db`
* `db:sqlite:/var/db/foo.sqlite`

Other engines may use a database name rather than a file name:

* `db:ingres:mydb`
* `db:postgresql:template1`

When a URI includes an authority part, it must be preceded by a double slash:

* `db:postgresql://example.com/`
* `db:mysql://root@localhost/`
* `db:pg://postgres:secr3t@example.net`

Formally, the authority part requires a host name, but some implementations,
inspired by the [file scheme](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File_URI_scheme),
might allow an empty host to imply localhost.

* `db:mysql:/root@`
* `db:postgres://postgres:secr3t@`
* `db:sqlite:///`

The path part contians the database name, separated from the authority by a
single slash:

* `db:postgresql://example.com/template1`
* `db:mongodb://localhost:27017/myDatabase`
* `db:oracle://scott:tiger@foo.com/scott`

Some databases, such as Firebird, take both a host name and a file path. Just
put the relative or absolute path after that slash, as appropriate:

* `db:firebird://localhost/test.gdb` - Relative
* `db:firebird://localhost/../test.gdb` - Relative
* `db:firebird://localhost/C:/temp/test.gdb` - Absolute
* `db:firebird://localhost/%2Ftmp/test.gdb` - Absolute

Note the percent-encoded slash in the last example. Formally, an absolute path
may not start with a slash, so we use its percent-encoded representation here.
In practice, implementations may recognize a leading slash, anyway:

* `db:firebird://localhost//tmp/test.gdb`

Any URI format may optionally have a query part containing key/value pairs:

* `db:sqlite:foo.db?foreign_keys=ON;journal_mode=WAL`
* `db:pg://localhost:5433/postgres?client_encoding=utf8;connect_timeout=10`

URIs may also have a fragment that names a specific database object. Since
database URIs will generally be used for connecting, this part may be ignored.

* `db:sqlite:my.db#users`
* `db:pg://localhost/postgres#pg_catalog.pg_class`.

### URI Compliance ###

Formally, a database URI as defined here is an opaque URI starting with `db:`
followed by an embedded server-style URI. For example, this database URI:

    db:pg://localhost/mydb

Is formally the URI `pg://localhost/mydb` embedded in an opaque `db:` URI. It
adheres to this formal definition because the scheme part of a URI is not
allowed to contain a sub-scheme (or subprotocol, in the
[JDBC parlance](http://docs.oracle.com/cd/B14117_01/java.101/b10979/urls.htm#BEIJFHHB)).
It is therefore a legal URI embedded in a second legal URI.

Informally, it's simpler to think of a database URI as a single URI starting
with the combination of the scheme and the engine, e.g., `db:pg`.

Some may recognize URIs as database URIs in the absence of the `db:` scheme,
provided their schemes correspond to widely-recognized database engines, such
as `postgresql`, `mysql`, `sqlite`, `mssql`, and `oracle`. These are not
formally recognized as standard schemes, though they may be recognized as
standard engines by the `db:` scheme specification.

### Inspiration ###

The format here is inspired by a lot of prior art.

* [JDBC URIs](http://docs.oracle.com/javase/6/docs/technotes/guides/jdbc/getstart/connection.html#997649)
  set the precedent for an opaque URI with a second, embedded URI, as
  [discussed here](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!topic/comp.lang.java.programmer/twkIYNaDS64).

* A number of database URI formats set the standard for `engine://authority/dbname`, including:
    * [PostgreSQL libpq URIs](http://www.postgresql.org/docs/9.3/static/libpq-connect.html#LIBPQ-CONNSTRING)
    * [SQLAlchemy URLs](http://docs.sqlalchemy.org/en/rel_0_9/core/engines.html#database-urls)
    * [Stackato database URLs](http://docs.stackato.com/3.0/user/services/data-services.html#database-url)
    * [Django database URLs](https://github.com/kennethreitz/dj-database-url)
    * [Rails database URLs](https://github.com/glenngillen/rails-database-url)
    * [Ruby Pg URL](https://bitbucket.org/eradman/ruby-pg-url)

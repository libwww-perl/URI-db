Revision history for Perl extension URI::db.

0.18
      - Added URI::redshift to support db:redshift: URIs, thanks to a pull
        request from Steve Caldwell (PR #12).
      - Added URI::exasol, thanks to Johan Wärlander.

0.17  2016-02-03T18:35:33Z
      - Added URI::_ado, which subclasses URI::_odbc to provide a `dbi_dsn()`
        that returns a DSN using DBD::ADO. NOTE: This class is experimental,
        since I was unable to figure out the best default values for the
        connection string -- there are so many options! Feedback and
        recommendations wanted (Issue #11).
      - The `dbi_dsn` method of URI::mssql now supports a single argument to
        specify the DBI driver for which to return a DSN. Pass in "sybase" or
        "ado" (experimental) to get a DSN for either of those drivers,
        instead. Based on work by Dan Muey.

0.16  2015-09-22T00:17:07Z
      - Added new abstract class, URI::_odbc, for URIs that use ODBC in
        `dbi_dsn`.
      - The `dbi_dsn` method of URI::mssql now returns an ODBC DSN instead of
        DBD::Sybase, since the latter would require Sybase to build.
      - URI::sqlserver now inherits from URI::mssql rather than the other way
        around.
      - Fixed a bug where a URI with three slashes but no authority part after
        the first two would incorrectly think the databse name should be an
        absolute path. That is, in "db:sqlite:///foo.db", the `dbname` value
        is "foo.db", not "/foo.db". Thanks to Dan Book for the report
        (issue #8).

0.15  2014-09-04T00:29:46Z
      - Added the `canonical_engine` accessor, which returns the canonical
        engine name.
      - Added `the canonical` method, which will replace the engine name with
        its canonical value if it's not already canonical.

0.14  2014-09-03T00:28:37Z
      - The `dbi_dsn` method of URI::vertica now returns an ODBC DSN instead
        of DBD::Pg, since the latter apparently does not work with Verica.
      - Added a note to the `dbi_dsn` documentation that query params are
        included in the returned value.

0.13  2014-08-09T22:48:53Z
      - Added URI::postgresxc and URI::pgxc, which simply inherit from
        URI::pg.
      - Added URI::ldapdb, which represents LDAP databases. Patch from Brian
        T. Wightman.

0.12  2014-01-10T17:23:35Z
      - Eliminated "v-string in use/require non-portable" warning on older
        Perls.

0.11  2014-01-03T20:01:01Z
      - Fixed URI::oracle to properly generate a DBI DSN with no host name or
        port.
      - The `dbi_dsn()` method in URI::sqlserver (and its subclasses) now
        generates a DSN using DBD::Sybase, rather than DBD::ODBC.

0.10  2013-12-20T00:16:30Z
      - Initial version.

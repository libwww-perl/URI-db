URI/db version 0.21
===================

This library implements a Perl interface for a proposed standard for database
connection URIs. The basic formats are:

* `db:engine://username:password@example.com:8042/over/there/widget.db?type=animal&name=narwhal`
* `db:engine:my_big_fat_database?subject=Topic`

This library also includes an interface to convert database URIs to
[DBI](https://metacpan.org/module/DBI) DSNs. For additional information on the
format, see `README.md`.

**Warning:** This is an alpha release. I will do my best to preserve
functionality going forward, especially as [Sqitch](http://sqitch.org/) uses
this module. However, as the database URI specification moves forward, changes
*may* require backwards-incompatible changes. Caveat Hackor.
